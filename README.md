## Uzo_Uwaz-MiniProject2
 IDS 706 Week 2-3 : This is Week 2-3 Mini Project of Reading and Describing a Dataset. It establishes an environment on codespaces and uses Github Actinos to run a Makefile for : make install, make test, make format, and make lint. It loads the Top Wealthiest data set from Kaggler and runs a function to generate a pie chart as well as some summary statistics about the data.

Important files include

1. Makefile - needed for installation, formatting, testing and linting

2. Dockerfile - defines the environment ensuring this program will run the same for all devices

3. A base set of libraries - needed to run the functions 

The data we will be analyzing will be from Kaggle.com. We will be analyzing the top 1000 wealthiest people in the world. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadehsan02/top-1000-wealthiest-people-in-the-world)

### From here we can see that Technology is the most lucrative of indsutries to immerse oneself in... I guess it's a lucky thing that we're studying Data Science! 

### The summary Statistics are as follows 
mean = 102 billion in networth 
std = 56 billion from mean 
min networth = 1.57 billion
max networth = 199 billion
